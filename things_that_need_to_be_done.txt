-> removal of src/ts/_utils_to_be_removed

   IFF they are needed, use @aniojs/node-ts-utils instead

-> removal of src/ts/generateFunctionFactoryCode
   this needs to be done in js-and-web-runtime-and-rollup-plugins
   (reason: needs access to project path aliases)

-> removal of typescript utilities that are not
   related to the build process at all
